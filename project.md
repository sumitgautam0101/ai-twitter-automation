# OpenX — Architecture

> **Status:** the MVP is built. The full pipeline (fetch → filter → generate → schedule → publish), the FastAPI dashboard backend, and the React dashboard all exist. This document was written as a forward plan and has since been reconciled with what actually shipped; section "Build Phasing" at the end records the original phase ordering for context. Where the build diverged from the plan (config moved YAML→JSON, AI image generation dropped, GDELT/Finnhub replaced by Google News, a real HTTP API added), the prose below reflects the shipped behavior.

## Context

OpenX is an open-source, plugin-based tool for automated, AI-driven posting to **X (Twitter)**. Any "niche" (crypto, tech, finance, etc.) can be configured with its own content sources, AI persona/prompts, posting schedule with anti-bot randomness, optional Telegram approval gate, and a dashboard for full configuration. 18 niche profiles ship out of the box.



## Tech Stack

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language/runtime | Python 3.12, asyncio | Every library needed (X API, AI) is Python-first; runs on a cheap VPS or Raspberry Pi |
| HTTP client | httpx (async) | Concurrent fetching across all sources |
| Reddit | asyncpraw | Official async fork of PRAW |
| RSS/Atom | feedparser | Universal parser for the generic RSS plugin |
| YouTube | google-api-python-client + youtube-transcript-api | Channel data + transcripts |
| Scheduler | APScheduler (async, DB-backed job store) | Persists jobs in the same SQLite database, no Redis/Celery needed |
| Database | SQLite | Single file, zero-config, shared directly with the separate dashboard project |
| AI text | LiteLLM | One interface across OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/Ollama — fully swappable providers; default is a local Ollama model (no key). An offline template provider is available for tests/offline runs. |
| Images | Unsplash (stock) or the source item's own media | AI image *generation* (Pollinations/DALL·E) was dropped after Pollinations moved to a paid, rate-limited model; images now come only from real sources |
| X posting | Tweepy | Covers posting + media upload |
| Dashboard API | FastAPI + uvicorn | Thin HTTP layer the browser dashboard calls (`/api/*`) |
| Secrets | Encrypted at rest (Fernet) | API keys and platform credentials stored encrypted, key from `OPENSOCIAL_SECRET_KEY` (or a key file) |

---

## High-Level Structure

The system is organized as a set of plugin packages built around a shared "content item" format:

- **Sources** — one plugin per content source (or a generic RSS plugin reused across many feeds). Each plugin fetches and normalizes content into a common format. Adding a new source means adding a new plugin, with no changes elsewhere.
- **AI (text)** — generates post text from a content item and a niche's persona/prompt, via a swappable AI provider (Ollama by default — no API key required).
- **AI (images)** — supplies an image for a post, either from a stock photo provider (Unsplash) or the source item's own media, behind a single interface.
- **Publisher** — posts to X (via Tweepy), built behind a publisher interface so other platforms could be added later as additional plugins.
- **Scheduler** — decides when posts go out, with randomized timing/jitter to avoid bot-like patterns, and enforces daily post limits.
- **Core** — shared data models, the SQLite database layer, and the pipeline that ties fetch → filter → generate → schedule → publish together.

---

## Project Structure

OpenX is split into two independently-deployable projects sharing one SQLite database:

- **service** (Python) — everything described above in High-Level Structure: source plugins, filtering/dedup, AI text & image attachment, the X publisher, scheduler, CLI, **and** a FastAPI app that backs the dashboard. It owns the content/post/history tables and reads the configuration to know what to do.
- **dashboard** (React + Vite, separate project) — the configuration & monitoring UI described later. It calls the service's HTTP API (`/api/*`) for everything; it contains no automation logic and does not touch SQLite directly.

This split keeps automation and configuration cleanly separated: `service` owns *what happens*, `dashboard` owns *what's configured* and *what's shown*.

The dashboard does not write to SQLite itself (the original plan had it sharing the file directly). Instead the service exposes a small HTTP API: reads query the DB; fast state changes (approve/reject/edit, config edits, toggles) apply synchronously; slow actions (fetch/generate/publish) are enqueued in the `commands` table and run by the background worker that `opensocial serve` starts alongside the API.

---

## Core Data Model

Every source plugin returns content normalized into a common "content item" shape, which is the only thing the rest of the pipeline understands. It includes: a stable ID (used for de-duplication), the source name/category, title, body/summary text, URL, author, published/fetched timestamps, any media URLs, tags, language, an optional sentiment score, optional engagement stats (e.g. score/comments), and the raw original data for reference.

AI generation always works from this normalized item — it never needs to know which source it came from.

**Field availability varies by source.** Full `body` text is available from Reddit, YouTube (via transcript), Medium/Decrypt/The Block/YC Blog (via `content:encoded`), Dev.to, GitHub Releases, and the Guardian; the rest (Google News, CoinDesk, Reuters/MarketWatch, WHO, Nature/PhysOrg/Futurism, HBR, ArXiv, yfinance, ProductHunt, NASA) only provide a `summary`/excerpt — so the standard fallback is `content_for_ai = item.body or item.summary or item.title`. No shipped source currently populates `sentiment`, so it stays null and the prioritization blend redistributes its weight when no `sentiment_target` is set. `engagement` is a flexible JSON dict whose shape differs per source (Reddit: score/comments/upvote_ratio; YouTube: views/likes/comments; Hacker News: score/comments; Dev.to: reactions/comments/reading_time; ProductHunt: votes/comments; GitHub Releases: downloads) — most RSS-based sources leave it null. `language` is rarely provided per item (the Guardian is an exception) and otherwise defaults to `en`.

---

## Content Sources

13 source plugins ship, registered via `@register` on the `Source` ABC (`opensocial/sources/`). The generic `rss` plugin is reused across many feeds, so the per-niche source list covers far more outlets than there are plugins (Decrypt, CoinDesk, The Block, Reuters/MarketWatch, WHO, Nature/PhysOrg/Futurism, HBR, Indie Hackers, YC Blog, TechCrunch, Ars Technica, … are all `rss` feeds configured per niche).

| Plugin | Source | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `googlenews` | Google News RSS — global news/trend feed via per-query search RSS | none |
| `rss` | Generic RSS/Atom parser, reused for most feed-based outlets | none |
| `reddit` | Reddit (public `.json` endpoints via httpx) | none |
| `youtube` | YouTube Data API (with transcripts) | API key |
| `medium` | Medium RSS (by tag/category) | none |
| `hackernews` | Hacker News API | none |
| `devto` | Dev.to API | none |
| `github_releases` | GitHub Releases (GitHub REST API) | optional token |
| `arxiv` | ArXiv API | none |
| `producthunt` | Product Hunt API | API access |
| `nasa` | NASA API | API key (DEMO_KEY works) |
| `guardian` | The Guardian API | API key |
| `yfinance` | Yahoo Finance / yfinance (unofficial) | none |

**Removed:** GDELT (its DOC 2.0 API rate-limited at 1 req/5s and starved most niches — replaced by Google News) and Finnhub. Don't reintroduce them.

---

## Niche Profiles

Each niche (e.g. "crypto", "tech") is a **JSON** configuration profile under `config/niches/<slug>.json` (the source of truth; also mirrored into `niche_profiles`). It defines:

- **Persona** — voice/tone/style/length and the instructions used to turn a content item into a post (instructed to write standalone text, not assuming a link will be attached).
- **AI settings** — which text provider/model/temperature to use (`ai.text`).
- **Image source** — the per-niche `image_source` field: `unsplash` (stock), `content` (the source item's own media), or `none`.
- **Filters** — keyword blocklist, relevance keywords/threshold, max age, and near-duplicate threshold/window.
- **Prioritization** — recency/engagement/relevance/sentiment weights and the recency half-life.
- **Post types** — which of the seven types are enabled, with optional per-type daily caps and visual-rule overrides.
- **Independent take** — the daily independent-post job (count, eligible types, image mode).
- **Sources** — which source plugins are enabled for this niche, with source-specific settings (subreddits, channel IDs, feed URLs, search queries, limits).
- **Schedule** — posting time windows, posts-per-day range, and minimum gap between posts.
- **Approval** — optional per-niche Telegram gate (`required`, `timeout_minutes`, `on_timeout`).
- **Posting** — whether the post includes the source link (off by default, to keep X cost at $0.015/post).

18 niche profiles ship (ai, business, crypto, education, entertainment, finance, fitness, gaming, health, lifestyle, marketing, news, politics, science, self-improvement, sports, startups, tech). The dashboard lets users create new niches and edit every one of these settings.

## Post Types

Every generated post has a **post type** that selects the prompt template and the visual rule. The taxonomy (absorbed from a working reference implementation) is:

| Type | Intent | Visual rule | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `news` | A timely development; lead with the implication, not the headline. | always | source-derived |
| `spotlight` | Highlight a tool/repo/paper/product worth knowing. | always | source-derived |
| `insight` | A non-obvious observation or synthesis. | optional | source-derived **or** independent |
| `take` | A bold, opinionated stance on a topic or trend. | optional | source-derived **or** independent |
| `tip` | A specific, actionable how-to. | optional | source-derived **or** independent |
| `question` | Provokes genuine debate/replies. | rarely | source-derived **or** independent |
| `meme` | Witty, relatable to the niche (the image is the point). | always | source-derived **or** independent |

The post type is chosen per candidate during generation (the persona prompt is given the type and writes accordingly). Each niche's `post_types` config enables a subset, sets an optional **per-type daily cap**, and overrides the default visual rule. Visual rules resolve to `always` / `content_based` / `never` server-side (not trusted to the model) so the type→visual mapping stays consistent.

Cross-cutting generation rules baked into every persona prompt (these directly serve the "standalone, no-link" design in the Niche Profiles section):

- Never reference or hint at the source ("according to", outlet/account names, "saw this", links). Write it as an original thought.
- Strong scroll-stopping hook on the first line; no corporate filler ("excited to share").
- Respect the platform character limit, counting every URL as a flat 23 chars (t.co wrapping); one rewrite-to-fit pass before accepting an over-limit draft.
- Strip wrapping quotes/backticks the model adds around the text.

### Independent posts (e.g. the daily Take)

Most posts are **source-derived** (built from a `content_item`). Some types can also be **independent** — generated purely from the niche persona/topic with no content item behind them (`generated_posts.content_item_id IS NULL`).

A niche's `independent_take` config schedules **at least one independent post per day** (default: one `take`): a dedicated daily job asks the AI to write an original take in the niche's voice, sources or AI-generates an accompanying image, and enqueues it like any other draft. To guarantee it actually goes out (rather than losing the queue to fresher source-derived posts), one daily slot is reserved for the independent post, or it is enqueued with a priority floor. The set of independent-eligible types and the daily count are configurable.

---

## Pipeline / Data Flow

1. **Fetch** — each enabled source is polled on its own schedule; new items are de-duplicated and stored, then linked to whichever niches they're relevant to.
2. **Filter** — each niche applies its blocklist/keyword/age filters and a near-duplicate check against recently seen content, marking items as candidates, filtered, or duplicates.
3. **Generate** — for each niche, the highest-priority candidates (by recency, engagement, **relevance**, and sentiment match) are assigned a post type and turned into draft post text via the niche's persona/prompt, and an image is attached per the type's visual rule. A separate daily job generates the niche's **independent post(s)** (e.g. the daily Take) with no source item behind them.
4. **Schedule** — each niche's posting day is resolved to a set of slot times once per calendar day: a random number of slots (within the configured range) at random times within the posting windows, with the jitter **rolled once and cached** so "is this slot due yet?" doesn't flicker as the scheduler ticks. Posts are **not** pre-assigned to slots at generation time.
5. **Publish** — when a slot fires, the engine picks the **best-scoring eligible queued post at that moment** (highest priority, respecting per-type/per-niche/global caps) rather than a pre-assigned one, so fresh high-priority content can jump the queue. If approval is required the post is sent to Telegram for review; otherwise (or once approved) it's posted to X, with the source link included or omitted per the niche's setting, and the result (success/failure, cost) is recorded. If the engine was down across slot times, it **catches up** to the number of slots that should have fired today.

Safety and modes (absorbed from the reference implementation):

- **Dry-run by default** — publishing is live only when explicitly enabled (`POST_DRY_RUN=false`); any other value stays dry and only logs what *would* post. Fail-safe so nothing goes out by accident.
- **`app_mode: manual | auto`** — in `manual`, the engine never publishes on its own; drafts wait in the queue until "Post now" is triggered. In `auto`, slots publish automatically.
- **Posting state machine** — a failed publish increments `post_attempts` and records `post_error`; after the max attempts the draft is marked `failed`.
- **Overlap guard** — a scheduled job that is still running when its next tick fires skips that tick rather than running twice.

A global daily post cap acts as a cross-niche safety net on top of each niche's own per-type and per-niche posting limits.

SQLite tables (SQLAlchemy models + Alembic migrations). JSON columns are stored as serialized text. Each table is tagged with the build phase that introduces it.

## Dashboard (Separate Project)

The web dashboard is a **React + Vite** app (`dashboard/`). It does **not** touch SQLite directly (the original plan had it sharing the file); instead it calls the service's FastAPI backend over HTTP. The backend (`opensocial/api.py`, started by `opensocial serve`) serves reads from the DB, applies fast state changes synchronously, and routes slow actions through the `commands` queue to the background worker.

Pages: **Dashboard** (overview), **Niches** (full per-niche config editor), **Queue** (draft posts — approve/reject/edit), **Schedule** (slot times, randomize), **Sources** (per-source toggles, settings, credentials), **History** (publish history + cost), **Logs** (mirrored service logs), **Settings** (dry-run/app-mode/caps, secrets), **RawData** (stored content items).

Key API groups (`/api/*`): `status`/`settings`/`overview`, `niches` (+ `followed`, `schedule`, `randomize`), `posts` (+ approve/reject/edit), `content`, `history`, `logs`, `sources` (+ origins), `ai`, `commands`, `credentials`.

---

## Cost Tracking

Cost per post is recorded in `post_history.cost_estimate` as $0.015 (text-only) or $0.20 (with link), plus $0.001 per analytics read. The dashboard sums these for spend tracking and shows the cost difference live when toggling whether a post includes the source link.

---

## Build Phasing

All phases below are **complete**, plus a dashboard/API phase (Phase 6) not in the original plan: the FastAPI backend (`opensocial/api.py`), the `app_settings` runtime-settings/secrets table, the `serve` command (API + background worker), autopilot draft refresh, and the React + Vite dashboard.

**Phase 1 — Sources**
Core data models (`ContentItem`) and database tables for `content_items` and `content_item_niches`; the source plugin framework (`Source` ABC + registry) and the generic RSS plugin; a first set of real plugins covering each source category (e.g. generic RSS, Hacker News, Google News, Reddit, YouTube) to prove the pattern across both API- and feed-based sources; one simplified niche profile (with the user-selected subreddits/YouTube channels and category-based source toggles); and a CLI command to fetch and store content, de-duplicated across repeat runs.

**Phase 2 — Data Extraction & Prioritization**
Filtering (keyword blocklist, relevance keywords/threshold, age limits) and near-duplicate detection against recently seen content, marking each item as candidate, filtered, or duplicate; candidate prioritization by recency, engagement, and sentiment match, producing an ordered queue of candidates per niche.

**Phase 3 — Post Creation**
AI text generation via LiteLLM (Ollama by default, no API key needed) that turns prioritized candidates into standalone, no-link draft posts via the niche's persona/prompt, with a **post type** per draft (news/spotlight/insight/take/tip/question/meme) selecting the template and visual rule; the cross-cutting prompt rules (no source references, strong hook, URL-aware length with one rewrite-to-fit pass, quote stripping); AI/stock image attachment per the type's visual rule; the **independent post** path (generate a take/etc. with no source item) including the **daily Take** job; the `generated_posts` table (with `post_type`, `priority_score`, and the `post_attempts`/`post_error` state-machine columns); and CLI commands to generate drafts and preview (dry-run) what would be published.

**Phase 4 — Automation**
The X publisher (Tweepy, text-only by default per the cost strategy) with **dry-run as the fail-safe default** and the `post_attempts`/`post_error` retry state machine; the scheduler (APScheduler) with randomized posting windows, **jitter rolled once per day and cached**, **best-at-slot-time** post selection (not pre-assignment) with catch-up, per-type/per-niche/global caps, an overlap guard, and the `manual`/`auto` app mode; the dashboard↔service **command queue** (`commands` table) and **log mirror** (`logs` table); the `post_history` table and cost tracking; remaining source plugins and niche templates (crypto, finance, science, news, business) so every content category is fully populated.

**Phase 5 — Post lifecycle & approval**
The post-lifecycle transitions (edit / regenerate / reject), driven from the dashboard. A draft's status is one of `draft`, `published`, `rejected`, `failed`. On top of that, each niche can opt into an **optional Telegram approval gate** (`approval.py`): when `approval.required` is set, a fresh draft is sent to Telegram for approve/edit/regenerate/reject before it can publish, and `sweep_timeouts` enforces the configured `on_timeout` behavior (auto-post or discard) when no decision arrives in time.

**Phase 6 — Dashboard & API** (added beyond the original plan)
The FastAPI backend the dashboard calls (`opensocial/api.py`); the `serve` command running the API and a background worker together; `resolve_settings` overlaying dashboard runtime toggles (`app_settings`) on the environment; autopilot draft refresh inside the posting window; Fernet-encrypted secrets saved from the dashboard; and the React + Vite dashboard (`dashboard/`).

---

## Verification

- **Phase 1**: Fetching a niche pulls content from its enabled sources, normalizes it to `ContentItem`, and stores it without creating duplicates on repeat runs.
- **Phase 2**: Filtering and de-duplication correctly mark items as candidate/filtered/duplicate, and the resulting candidate queue is ordered by recency, engagement, and sentiment match.
- **Phase 3**: Generating posts for a niche produces draft text via the AI provider that reads as a standalone post (no dangling "read more"/link references), confirming the no-link-by-default design; each draft carries a valid post type with the correct visual rule applied; the daily Take job produces an independent draft (no `content_item_id`) with an image; a dry-run publish step prints what would be posted without calling the real X API; an automated test covers fetch → filter → generate end-to-end using a mocked AI response.
- **Phase 4**: A slot fires at a randomized (once-per-day, cached) time within its niche's posting window, publishes the best-scoring eligible queued post at that moment (not a pre-assigned one), respects the minimum gap and per-type/per-niche/global caps, and records a `post_history` row with the correct cost estimate; with `POST_DRY_RUN` unset nothing is actually published; a failed publish increments `post_attempts` and lands on `failed` after the max; a `post_now` row in `commands` triggers an on-demand publish.
- **Phase 5**: A draft requiring approval is sent to Telegram with working approve/edit/regenerate/reject buttons, and the configured timeout behavior (auto-post or discard) fires correctly.
