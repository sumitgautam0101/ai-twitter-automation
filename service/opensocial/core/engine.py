"""Phase 4 publish engine — best-at-slot-time selection + state machine.

When a slot is due the engine picks the **best-scoring eligible queued post at
that moment** (not a pre-assigned one), so fresh high-priority content can jump
the queue. It enforces, in order: the global daily cap, the per-niche slot
count, the minimum gap since the last publish, and per-type daily caps. Each
publish runs through the retry state machine: a failure bumps ``post_attempts``
and records ``post_error``; after ``max_post_attempts`` the draft is ``failed``.

Publishing honors the dry-run fail-safe via the injected publisher — in dry-run
a ``post_history`` row is still recorded (status ``success``, cost as it would
be) so the dashboard reflects what *would* have gone out.
