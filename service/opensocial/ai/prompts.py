"""Prompt assembly: persona + post-type template + cross-cutting rules.

The persona comes from the niche config as three per-niche controls — a **style**
(casual / funny / informative / professional / question / supportive), a target
**length** (very_short … long), and free-text **instructions** — that the
dashboard's General tab edits. (A legacy free-text ``voice``/``tone`` is still
honored as a fallback when no style is set.) The post type selects an intent
template; and a fixed set of cross-cutting rules — absorbed from a working
reference implementation — is appended to every prompt so drafts come out
standalone and link-free regardless of niche or type.

``build_messages`` returns ``(system, user)`` for any ``TextProvider``. The
``user`` block always carries a ``SUBJECT:`` line, which the offline
:class:`~opensocial.ai.text.TemplateProvider` keys off so generation is
testable without a model.

    "- Never use markdown of any kind (no **bold**, *italics*, backticks, "
    "headings, or bullet points) and no dashes. Not even hyphens between words, "
    "not en dashes, not em dashes. Use a comma, a period, or a new sentence "
